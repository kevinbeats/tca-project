    <h1>Report on my module Experiences</h1>
    <p>
        <br>
        <br>
        I started this course with absolutely little to no knowledge about Coding or web development or anything that has to do with the technicalities of IT. I would say that my first year experiences were quite insightful, challenging and interesting especially for someone without an IT background.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the process of learning the basics, I got to understand that there are so many buzz words and technical words which make learning quite challenging for newbies. It is stressful in the sense that there are always new frameworks which means there is always the likelihood of jumping onto new things even when you are not a master of what you are currently learning. You never stop learning as day in day out, there are new things to learn in order to meet industry standards. You spend twice the time for writing codes in the process of debugging as without debugging you can not move on with your work and this stalls  productivity. Also, there is always Imposter syndrome almost every time you check another devs profile but you only have to compare your knowledge with what you know about a week ago especially in web development.
        <br>
        <br>
        Through all these challenges there is the tendency to doubt your self worth asking if you are even good enough or even losing motivation as at a point in time I almost gave up.
        However despite all of these, my journey into the course has taught me to be consistent as once you understand the basics you only have to worry about the different syntax of other frameworks. Also, learning coding and other aspects of web development has progressed my thoughts on IT to an expanded level and I feel a strong sense of belonging to the bigger community of people who are into IT.
